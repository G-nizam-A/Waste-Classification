# Waste detection using faster-rcnn (resnet50)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Please note that the accuracy of the classification may be limited as the model is trained on a small dataset.
> 

## Overview

This project implements waste object classification using the Faster R-CNN algorithm with a ResNet50 model. The backend is developed in Python, utilizing the TensorFlow framework for training and inference. The frontend is developed using React for the user interface.

# Setup
> [!NOTE]
> Make sure you have Python (above `v3.9`) and node (above `v16.0`) installed on your system before running the project.
